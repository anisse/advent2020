My rust workspace for [advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). Every solution is sub-optimal, or could be improved upon, but this was written mostly as a learning opportunity. I'm putting it out there to expose the process of learning.

I recommend attempting to solve the puzzles yourself before looking at the solutions.
